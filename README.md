# Kotlin Problem Solving Solutions

This repository contains solutions to various coding problems and algorithmic challenges,
all implemented in the Kotlin programming language.

## Overview

This repository includes solutions to common data structures and algorithm problems, covering topics such as:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Graphs
- Sorting and Searching
- Dynamic Programming
- and more


Each solution is self-contained and can be run independently. The repository is organized by topic,
with each problem solution located in its own directory. Each solution is organized to contain:

1. A comment with the description of the problem and the URL of the problem if found.
2. A main function with one or more examples that can be run to verify the output or for the purpose
   of debugging and tracking the flow.

The directory structure and file organization should make it easy for anyone to navigate
the repository and understand the purpose of each solution.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to have Kotlin installed on your system. You can download the latest
version of Kotlin from the official website: [https://kotlinlang.org/](https://kotlinlang.org/)

Once you have Kotlin installed, you can clone this repository and start exploring the solutions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShabanKamell/ProblemSolving
cd ProblmSolving
```
