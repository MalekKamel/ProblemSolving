/**
 * You are visiting a farm to collect fruits. The farm has a single row of fruit trees.
 * You will be given two baskets, and your goal is to pick as many fruits as possible to be placed in the given baskets.
 * You will be given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree.
 * The farm has the following restrictions:
 * Each basket can have only one type of fruit. There is no limit to how many fruit a basket can hold.
 * You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started.
 * You will pick exactly one fruit from every tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop
 * when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
 * Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both baskets.
