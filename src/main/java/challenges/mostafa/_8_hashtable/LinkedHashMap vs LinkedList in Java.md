# What is the difference between `LinkedList` and `LinkedHashMap` in Java?

Ah, that's a great question! Even though their names sound similar, `LinkedHashMap` and `LinkedList`
in Java serve very different purposes and have distinct underlying structures. Let's break down the
key differences:

**LinkedList:**

* **Purpose:** `LinkedList` implements the `List` interface, focusing on providing efficient
  insertion and deletion of elements at any position. It's designed to be good at manipulating the
  order of elements.
* **Underlying Structure:** It's a **doubly-linked list**. Each element (node) in the list contains
  the actual data and pointers (references) to the previous and next elements in the sequence.
* **Performance Characteristics:**
    * **Insertion/Deletion:** Generally **fast** (O(1)) at any position, assuming you already have a
      reference to the location. Traversing to that location takes O(n).
    * **Accessing Elements (get(index)):** **Slow** (O(n)) because you need to traverse the list
      from the beginning (or end, in some implementations) to reach the desired index.
    * **Searching for a Specific Element:** **Slow** (O(n)) as you might need to examine every
      element.
* **Ordering:** Maintains the **insertion order** of elements.
* **Use Cases:** Suitable for scenarios where you perform frequent insertions and deletions, like
  implementing stacks, queues, or when you need to iterate through the elements in order and modify
  the list frequently.

**LinkedHashMap:**

* **Purpose:** `LinkedHashMap` extends `HashMap` and implements the `Map` interface. Its primary
  goal is to provide the key-value mapping functionality of a `HashMap` while also preserving the *
  *insertion order** of the keys. Optionally, it can also maintain access order.
* **Underlying Structure:** It's a combination of a **hash table** (like `HashMap`) for efficient
  key lookups and a **doubly-linked list** that runs through all its entries. This linked list
  defines the iteration ordering.
* **Performance Characteristics:**
    * **Insertion/Deletion:** Average **O(1)** for adding new key-value pairs. Removing an existing
      entry is also generally **O(1)**.
    * **Accessing Elements (get(key)):** Average **O(1)**, similar to `HashMap`.
    * **Searching for a Key:** Average **O(1)**, thanks to the underlying hash table.
    * **Iteration:** Order is predictable (either insertion order or access order), and iteration
      takes time proportional to the number of entries in the map (O(n)).
* **Ordering:** Maintains either the **insertion order** of key-value pairs or the **access order
  ** (the order in which entries were last accessed using `get()` or `put()`). You can specify this
  behavior when creating the `LinkedHashMap`.
* **Use Cases:** Useful when you need a map where you also need to iterate through the entries in
  the order they were inserted (e.g., maintaining the order of items in a configuration file) or in
  the order they were last accessed (e.g., implementing a least-recently-used (LRU) cache).

**Here's a table summarizing the key differences:**

| Feature                       | LinkedList                                  | LinkedHashMap                                        |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Interface**                 | `List`                                      | `Map`                                                |
| **Primary Goal**              | Efficient insertion/deletion at any point   | Key-value mapping with ordered iteration             |
| **Underlying Data Structure** | Doubly-linked list                          | Hash table + doubly-linked list                      |
| **Insertion/Deletion**        | O(1) (if location is known), O(n) otherwise | Average O(1)                                         |
| **Accessing Element**         | O(n)                                        | Average O(1) (by key)                                |
| **Searching**                 | O(n)                                        | Average O(1) (by key)                                |
| **Ordering**                  | Insertion order                             | Insertion order (default) or access order (optional) |
| **Use Cases**                 | Stacks, queues, frequent list modifications | Ordered key-value storage, LRU caches                |

In essence, `LinkedList` is about managing a sequence of elements efficiently for modifications,
while `LinkedHashMap` is about having a fast key-value lookup with the added benefit of predictable
iteration order. They address different needs in Java programming.

# In Java, What is the difference between HashMap and LinkedHashMap?

Ah, a classic Java question! As a fellow software engineer, you'll appreciate the nuances here. Both
`HashMap` and `LinkedHashMap` are implementations of the `Map` interface in Java, providing
key-value storage with efficient retrieval. However, they differ in a crucial aspect: **ordering**.

Here's a breakdown of their key differences:

**1. Ordering of Entries:**

* **HashMap:** Does **not** guarantee any specific order of its entries. The order in which elements
  are stored and retrieved can change over time and is generally unpredictable. It's based on the
  hash codes of the keys.
* **LinkedHashMap:** Maintains the **insertion order** of its entries. This means that when you
  iterate through a `LinkedHashMap`, you will get the entries in the same order they were inserted
  into the map. Alternatively, it can also be configured to maintain **access order**. In access
  order, the least recently accessed entry moves to the end of the iteration order.

**2. Underlying Data Structure:**

* **HashMap:** Internally uses a hash table (an array of buckets) to store its entries.
* **LinkedHashMap:** Extends `HashMap` and uses a doubly-linked list in addition to the hash table.
  This linked list maintains the insertion order (or access order) of the entries. Each entry in the
  `LinkedHashMap` has pointers to the next and previous entries in the linked list.

**3. Performance:**

* **HashMap:** Generally offers slightly better performance for basic operations like `get`, `put`,
  and `remove` because it has less overhead (no linked list to maintain). Its average time
  complexity for these operations is O(1), assuming good distribution of hash codes.
* **LinkedHashMap:** Has slightly slower performance for `get`, `put`, and `remove` operations
  compared to `HashMap` due to the overhead of maintaining the doubly-linked list. However, its time
  complexity for these operations is still O(1) on average.
* **Iteration:** Iterating over the entries of a `LinkedHashMap` is generally faster than iterating
  over a `HashMap`, especially for large maps. This is because the iteration in `LinkedHashMap`
  follows the linked list, which has a predictable order. Iterating over a `HashMap` might involve
  traversing through empty buckets in the underlying array.

**4. Use Cases:**

* **HashMap:** Suitable when you need fast key-based access and the order of entries is not
  important. It's the go-to choice for general-purpose map implementations where performance for
  `get`, `put`, and `remove` is the primary concern.
* **LinkedHashMap:** Useful when you need to maintain a specific order of entries, such as:
    * **Maintaining insertion order:** For scenarios where you want to process entries in the order
      they were added (e.g., implementing a simple cache or maintaining the order of items in a
      configuration file).
    * **Implementing an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache:** By configuring it to use access order,
      the least recently accessed elements will be at the beginning of the iteration order, making
      it easy to remove them.

**In summary:**

| Feature                      | HashMap                               | LinkedHashMap                               |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Ordering                     | No guaranteed order                   | Insertion order (or access order)           |
| Data Structure               | Hash table                            | Hash table + doubly-linked list             |
| Performance (get/put/remove) | Generally faster                      | Slightly slower                             |
| Performance (iteration)      | Can be slower, depends on load factor | Generally faster                            |
| Use Cases                    | Fast access, order not important      | Maintaining order, LRU cache implementation |

Choosing between `HashMap` and `LinkedHashMap` depends on the specific requirements of your
application. If you need ordering, `LinkedHashMap` is the way to go, even with the slight
performance trade-off for basic operations. If order doesn't matter and performance is critical for
`get`, `put`, and `remove`, `HashMap` is usually the better choice.
